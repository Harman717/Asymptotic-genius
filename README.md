Our project on asymptotic notation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web
application that helps users understand and visualize asymptotic notation concepts. The goal
of this project is to provide an easy user interface that allows users to enter algebraic
expressions and visualize the growth rate of a function using different asymptotic symbols such
as Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta.
To achieve this goal, we used our knowledge of algebraic expressions and algorithmic analysis
to create a backend function that calculates the growth rate of the input function. The results
are displayed in interactive graphs that visualize the growth rate using different asymptotic
symbols.
The aim of this project is to provide a suitable and intuitive tool for students and professionals
who need to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms. Using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, we aim to make our apps easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection
and a browser. Our project is based on the mathematical concepts of asymptotic notation, and
we hope to use this project to make these concepts available to a wider audience.
